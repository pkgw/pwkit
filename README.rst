pwkit: miscellaneous Python for science and astronomy
*****************************************************

This is a collection of Peter Williams’ miscellaneous Python tools. I’m
packaging them so that other people can install them off of PyPI and run my
code without having to go to too much work. That’s the hope, at least.

The online documentation contains `installation instructions`_. The
documentation is very much a work in progress but `may be found here`_.

If you use pwkit in academic work, you should identify that you have done so
and specify the version used. While pwkit does not (yet?) have an accompanying
formal publication, in journals like `ApJ`_ you can “cite” the code directly via `its
record`_ in the `NASA Astrophysics Data System`_, which has identifier
`2017ascl.soft04001W`_. This corresponds to record `ascl:1704.001`_ in in the
`Astrophysics Source Code Library`_. By clicking on `this link`_ you can
get the ADS-recommended BibTeX record for the reference.

If you are using `aastex`_ version 6 or higher, the appropriate code to
include after your Acknowledgments section would be:

.. _aastex: http://journals.aas.org/authors/aastex.html

.. code-block:: none
