        """Get a context manager that creates and cleans up a uniquely-named temporary
        file with a name similar to this path.

        This function returns a context manager that creates a secure
        temporary file with a path similar to *self*. In particular, if
        ``str(self)`` is something like ``foo/bar``, the path of the temporary
        file will be something like ``foo/bar.ame8_2``.

        The object returned by the context manager depends on the *want* argument:

        ``"handle"``
          An open file-like object is returned. This is the object returned by
          :class:`tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile`. Its name on the filesystem is
          accessible as a string as its `name` attribute, or (a customization here)
          as a :class:`Path` instance as its `path` attribute.
        ``"path"``
          The temporary file is created as in ``"handle"``, but is then immediately
          closed. A :class:`Path` instance pointing to the path of the temporary file is
          instead returned.

        If an exception occurs inside the context manager block, the temporary file is
        left lying around. Otherwise, what happens to it upon exit from the context
        manager depends on the *resolution* argument:

        ``"try_unlink"``
          Call :meth:`try_unlink` on the temporary file — no exception is raised if
          the file did not exist.
        ``"unlink"``
          Call :meth:`unlink` on the temporary file — an exception is raised if
          the file did not exist.
        ``"keep"``
          The temporary file is left lying around.
        ``"overwrite"``
          The temporary file is :meth:`rename`-d to overwrite *self*.

        For instance, when rewriting important files, it’s typical to write
        the new data to a temporary file, and only rename the temporary file
        to the final destination at the end — that way, if a problem happens
        while writing the new data, the original file is left unmodified;
        otherwise you’d be stuck with a partially-written version of the file.
        This pattern can be accomplished with::

          p = Path ('path/to/important/file')
          with p.make_tempfile (resolution='overwrite', mode='wt') as h:
              print ('important stuff goes here', file=h)

        The *suffix* argument is appended to the temporary file name after the
        random portion. It defaults to the empty string. If you want it to
        operate as a typical filename suffix, include a leading ``"."``.
