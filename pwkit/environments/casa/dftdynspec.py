casatask dftdynspec vis=<MS> [keywords...]

Extract a dynamic spectrum from the visibilities in a measurement set. See
below the keyword docs for some important caveats.

vis=
  Path of the MeasurementSet dataset to read. Required.

out=
  Path to which data will be written. If unspecified, data are written to
  standard output.

rephase=RA,DEC
  Phase the data to extract fluxes in the specified direction. If unspecified,
  the data are not rephased, i.e. the flux at the phase center is extracted.
  RA and DEC should be in sexigesimal with fields separated by colons.

array=, baseline=, field=, observation=, polarization=, scan=,
scanintent=, spw=, taql=, time=, uvdist=
  MeasurementSet selectors used to filter the input data. Default polarization
  is 'RR,LL'. All polarizations are averaged together, so mixing parallel- and
  cross-hand pols is almost never what you want to do.

  NOTE: only whole spectral windows can be selected. If you attempt to select
  channels within a window, a warning will be printed and that component of
  the selection will be ignored.

datacol=
  Name of the column to use for visibility data. Defaults to 'data'. You might
  want it to be 'corrected_data'.

believeweights=[t|f]
  Defaults to false, which means that we assume that the 'weight' column in
  the dataset is NOT scaled such that the variance in the visibility samples
  is equal to 1/weight. In this case uncertainties are assessed from the
  scatter of all the visibilities in each timeslot. If true, we trust that
  variance=1/weight and propagate this in the standard way.

IMPORTANT: the fundamental assumption of this task is that the only
signal in the visibilities is from a point source at the phasing
center. We also assume that all sampled polarizations get equal
contributions from the source (though you can resample the Stokes
parameters on the fly, so this is not quite the same thing as
requiring the source be unpolarized).

The output data are stored as a file containing several serialized Numpy
arrays. The Python class `pwkit.environments.casa.dftdynspec.Loader` can be
used to load the data into a Python program.
