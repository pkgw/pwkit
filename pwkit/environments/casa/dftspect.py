"""
casatask dftspect vis=<MS> [keywords...]

Extract fluxes from the visibilities in a measurement set as a function of
spectral window (and hence, presumably, frequency). See below the keyword docs
for some important caveats.

vis=
  Path of the MeasurementSet dataset to read. Required.

out=
  Path to which data will be written. If unspecified, data are written to
  standard output.

rephase=RA,DEC
  Phase the data to extract fluxes in the specified direction. If unspecified,
  the data are not rephased, i.e. the flux at the phase center is extracted.
  RA and DEC should be in sexigesimal with fields separated by colons.

array=, baseline=, field=, observation=, polarization=, scan=,
scanintent=, spw=, taql=, time=, uvdist=
  MeasurementSet selectors used to filter the input data. Default polarization
  is 'RR,LL'. All polarizations are averaged together, so mixing parallel- and
  cross-hand pols is almost never what you want to do.

datacol=
  Name of the column to use for visibility data. Defaults to 'data'. You might
  want it to be 'corrected_data'.

datascale=
  Multiply fluxes by this number before reporting them. Defaults to 1e6, so
  that the output is in terms of microjanskys if the data are correctly
  flux-scaled. The textual output has two decimal places so adjusting this
  value can give better results if your characteristic fluxes are
  significantly different than this.

believeweights=[t|f]
  Defaults to false, which means that we assume that the 'weight' column in
  the dataset is NOT scaled such that the variance in the visibility samples
  is equal to 1/weight. In this case uncertainties are assessed from the
  scatter of all the visibilities in each timeslot. If true, we trust that
  variance=1/weight and propagate this in the standard way.

format=[humane(default)|pandas]
  The format of the output. The default is "humane" which is described below.
  The "pandas" format is slightly less human-friendly but can be read directly
  into a Pandas DataFrame with pandas.read_table ().

IMPORTANT: the fundamental assumption of this task is that the only signal in
the visibilities is from a point source at the phasing center. We also assume
that all sampled polarizations get equal contributions from the source (though
you can resample the Stokes parameters on the fly, so this is not quite the
same thing as requiring the source be unpolarized).

In the "humane" format, the output columns are:

  freq[GHz] spw# re reErr im imErr mag magErr npts

sorted by frequency, where the frequency is the mean frequency of its
associated spectral window. The units of re, im, mag, and their uncertainties
are microjansky by default, but see the datascale keyword, and there's no way
to know if the data have actually been flux-calibrated or not.
