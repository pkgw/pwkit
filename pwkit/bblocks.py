"""pwkit.bblocks - Bayesian Blocks analysis, with a few extensions.

Bayesian Blocks analysis for the "time tagged" case described by Scargle+
2013. Inspired by the bayesian_blocks implementation by Jake Vanderplas in the
AstroML package, but that turned out to have some limitations.

We have iterative determination of the best number of blocks (using an ad-hoc
routine described in Scargle+ 2013) and bootstrap-based determination of
uncertainties on the block heights (ditto).

Functions are:

:func:`bin_bblock`
  Bayesian Blocks analysis with counts and bins.
:func:`tt_bblock`
  BB analysis of time-tagged events.
:func:`bs_tt_bblock`
  Like :func:`tt_bblock` with bootstrap-based uncertainty assessment. NOTE:
  the uncertainties are not very reliable!

      Final value of p0, after iteration to minimize `nblocks`.
    *ledges*
      Times of left edges of output blocks.

    Bin start/stop times are best derived from a 1D Voronoi tesselation of the
    event arrival times, with some kind of global observation start/stop time
    setting the extreme edges. Or they can be set from "good time intervals"
    if observations were toggled on or off as in an X-ray telescope.

    If *intersect_with_bins* is True, the true Bayesian Blocks bins (BBBs) are
    intersected with the "good time intervals" (GTIs) defined by the *tstarts*
    and *tstops* variables. One GTI may contain multiple BBBs if the event
    rate appears to change within the GTI, and one BBB may span multiple GTIs
    if the event date does *not* appear to change between the GTIs. The
    intersection will ensure that no BBB intervals cross the edge of a GTI. If
    this would happen, the BBB is split into multiple, partially redundant
    records. Each of these records will have the **same** value for the
    *counts*, *rates*, and *widths* values. However, the *ledges*, *redges*,
    and *midpoints* values will be recalculated. Note that in this mode, it is
    not necessarily true that ``widths = ledges - redges`` as is usually the
    case. When this flag is true, keep in mind that multiple bins are
    therefore *not* necessarily independent statistical samples.
